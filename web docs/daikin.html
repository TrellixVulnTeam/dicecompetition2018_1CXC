			    	<p style="margin-top: -20px">An air conditioner (AC) works by taking the surrounding air into the unit, passing the air through a layer of filter and a cold heat exchanger (HX) coil to cool down <br>the air temperature, and finally discharge it through its air discharge opening into the surroundings again to regulate a room temperature.The filters in front of the <br>HX coil exist to prevent particles or dust from sticking to the heat exchanger while the AC draws in surroundings air to maintain optimum performance of the AC. <br>If the HX is filled with dust, heat exchange rate will decrease, warm air drawn in cannot be cool down by the HX efficiently as the dust will work as a heat insulator and <br>thus causing AC performance drop.While we have filter collecting dust from the air, it will become dusty and drop the AC performance. Energy consumption will <br>become higher. Thus, cleaning the air filter periodically is important for the AC. However, the common issue with AC users is that we do not know when to clean the <br>filter. Even if we know, due to its installation height, cleaning the filter will be a hack of a job and majority will skip the work until the AC is no longer cooling.
			    	<br>How can this problem be solved?</p>
			    

			    	<h4 style="color: black; margin-top: 15px">Business Organization Challenge</h4>
			    	<p style="margin-top: -20px">The challenge is to create a system to ensure optimum AC performance with clean filter.</p>
			    	<ul style="line-height: normal; margin-top: -30px; margin-left: 0px; list-style-image: url('./images/pen.png');"">
							  <li style="margin-top: -15px">The proposed solution could be preventing dust from sticking to the filter / HX in the first place, and thus solving the issue from the root cause.</li>
						
							  <li style="margin-top: 10px">The proposed solution could be a filter self-cleaning mechanism.</li>

							  <li style="margin-top: 10px">The proposed solution could be a filter dust level sensing system.</li>

							  <li style="margin-top: 10px">The proposed solution could also be filter cleaning system / mechanism that assists user to clean the filter.</li>
					</ul>


			    	<p style="margin-top: -20px">It is up to the team's creativity on how to tackle the design challenge. The best solution proposed will be evaluated based on:</p>
			    	
			    	<ul style="line-height: normal; margin-top: -30px; margin-left: 0px; list-style-image: url('./images/pen.png');"">
							  <li style="margin-top: -15px">Ease of use by the AC users</li>
						
							  <li style="margin-top: 10px">Ease of implementation by the manufacturer</li>
